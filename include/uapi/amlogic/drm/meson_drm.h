 * struct drm_meson_dma_buf_export_sync_file - Get a sync_file from a dma-buf
 *
 * Userspace can perform a DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE to retrieve the
 * current set of fences on a dma-buf file descriptor as a sync_file.  CPU
 * waits via poll() or other driver-specific mechanisms typically wait on
 * whatever fences are on the dma-buf at the time the wait begins.  This
 * is similar except that it takes a snapshot of the current fences on the
 * dma-buf for waiting later instead of waiting immediately.  This is
 * useful for modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan which assume an explicit
 * synchronization model but still need to inter-operate with dma-buf.
