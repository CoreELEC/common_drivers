	default n
	help
		Amlogic page trace will record function address of caller for page
		allocate/free, according with allocate flags and order. trace
		information is stored in a pre-allocated memory block. And can be shown
		with allocate page count information of each caller functions from
		/proc/pagetrace

	default n
	help
		This feature enable to inline page trace into high 32bits of
		page->flags on 64 bit kernel. Because other total page flags
		are less than 32bit, so It can help to save memory when
		use page trace. But it conflict with KASAN tags, so when kasan
		tags enabled, this feature will be auto disabled
